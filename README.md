## Most Loved Tools

I'd like to share some awesome tools/frameworks/languages that I used recently, which gave me a great dev experience.

- [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) - Repeatable Builds. Everywhere.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Crazy powerful dashboards for logs and metrics. They are doing a great job with their latest releases.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - End-to-end web testing framework with lots of great features.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Give it a shot if you never used it before. It's an awesome language.
- [Tanka](https://tanka.dev/) - Check out Tanka if you regularly work with Kubernetes. Gives a lot more flexibility than plain old YAML.
- [Vector](https://vector.dev/) - Ever needed to streamline logging? I can't recommend Vector enough.
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Currently my first choice for web development.
