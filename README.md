## Most Loved Tools

I'd like to share some awesome tools/frameworks/languages that I used recently, which gave me a great dev experience.

- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) - Linter & Formatter. Great alternative to Eslint.
- [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) - Repeatable Builds. Everywhere.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Powerful (and beautiful) dashboards for logs and metrics.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - End-to-end web testing framework with lots of great features.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Give it a shot if you never used it before. It's an awesome language.
- [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) - I've never used such a flexible database.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - Promising project for multi-platform frontends.
- [Vector](https://vector.dev/) - Ever needed to streamline logging? I can't recommend Vector enough.
- [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) - Converts markdown files into a nice looking static website for documentation.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Hot Reloading for tests. Do I need to say more?
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Currently my first choice for web development.
